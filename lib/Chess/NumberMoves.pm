 [EventDate "1963"]
 [White "Benko"]
 [Black "Najdorf"]
 [Result "*"]
 
 
 d4 Nf6
 c4 c5
 d5 d6
 Nc4 g6
 e4 Bg7
 Be2 O-O
 Nf3 e5
 Bg5 h6
 Bh4 g5
 Bg3 Nh5
 h4 Nf4
 hxg5 hxg5
 Bf1 Bg4
 Qc2 Bxf3
 gxf3 Nd7
 O-O-O Re8
 Bh3 Nxh3
 Rxh3 Nf8
 Rdh1 Ng6

 Rh8+ Rxd8

=head2 THEN WE NUMBER THE FILE

  use Chess::NumberMoves;
  my $numbered = Chess::NumberMoves::from_file('benko-najdorf.pgn');
  print $numbered;

=head1 ABSTRACT

  This is a program for numbering a file consisting of chess moves listed
  two per line.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Any line in the file which matches the regexp:

  /^[A-Z]/

has a line number prepended to it.

I wrote this because I was typing moves from a chess game listed in a book
("Simple Chess" by Michael Stean --- it rocks you should buy it!) but felt
it was not a good use of my time to keep entering numbers.

And presto-chango a little bit of Perl and here ya have it.

=head1 CONVENIENCE SCRIPT

A convenience script C<pgo2pgn> is included which
takes a file with C<.pgo> extension
and converts it to a pgn file, saving it with a C<.pgn> extension. The
conversion is to take a file which contains a pair of moves on each line and
number the lines.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
